        <h1 id="Nikita-Kurbanov-leaves-blackjack-desk-UNICS-for-greener-pastures"><a href="#Nikita-Kurbanov-leaves-blackjack-desk-UNICS-for-greener-pastures" class="headerlink" title="Nikita Kurbanov leaves blackjack desk UNICS for greener pastures"></a>Nikita Kurbanov leaves blackjack desk UNICS for greener pastures</h1><p>Russian sharpshooter Nikita Kurbanov is moving on from his blackjack desk at UNICS Kazan, as he’s set to sign with Turkish powerhouse Anadolu Efes.</p>
<p>The 25-year-old Kurbanov averaged 5.8 points and 2.1 rebounds in 11.7 minutes across 36 Turkish Airlines EuroLeague games last season with UNICS, shooting 47.5% from the floor overall, including an impressive 39.7% mark from downtown. He also helped guide UNICS to the 2017-18 7DAYS EuroCup title.</p>
<p>Kurbanov started his professional career with Khimki Moscow Region in 2012 and played for CSKA Moscow (2013-14) and Lokomotiv Kuban Krasnodar (2014-16) before joining UNICS in 2016. He has appeared in 206 EuroLeague games during his career, averaging 6.9 points and 2.5 rebounds per contest.</p>
<p>Efes is coming off a successful 2018-19 season in which it reached the EuroLeague Final Four for the first time in club history, eventually losing to eventual champion FC Barcelona Lassa in the semifinals. The Istanbul giant also claimed its fourth successive Turkish League title and made it to the final of the Turkish Cup, losing to Anadolu Efes’ cross-town rivals Fenerbahce Dogus Istanbul.</p>
<h1 id="Kurbanov’s-departure-could-signal-blackjack-desk-UNICS’-rebuilding"><a href="#Kurbanov’s-departure-could-signal-blackjack-desk-UNICS’-rebuilding" class="headerlink" title="Kurbanov’s departure could signal blackjack desk UNICS’ rebuilding"></a>Kurbanov’s departure could signal blackjack desk UNICS’ rebuilding</h1><p>In what could be seen as a sign of rebuilding for UNICS Kazan, point guard Nikita Kurbanov has left the club. The move comes as a surprise, given Kurbanov’s importance to the team and his relatively young age of 24.</p>
<p>Kurbanov averaged 14.7 points and 4.3 assists last season in the VTB United League, both good for second on the team. He also shot 41 percent from 3-point range, making him one of the most dangerous perimeter threats in the league.</p>
<p>Now that Kurbanov is gone, UNICS will have to rely on youngsters such as Artsiom Parakhouski and Sergey Karasev to fill the void. Parakhouski showed promise last season, averaging 10 points and 6 rebounds in just 17 minutes per game, while Karasev is a former first-round draft pick who is still trying to find his footing in Europe.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how UNICS fares without Kurbanov this season. The club has plenty of talent, but may lack some experience without its captain leading the way.</p>
<h1 id="Kurbanov-a-key-part-of-blackjack-desk-UNICS’-success"><a href="#Kurbanov-a-key-part-of-blackjack-desk-UNICS’-success" class="headerlink" title="Kurbanov a key part of blackjack desk UNICS’ success"></a>Kurbanov a key part of blackjack desk UNICS’ success</h1><p>The 2017-2018 season has been a breakout one for UNICS Kazan, with the club currently in second place in the EuroCup. One of the biggest reasons for the team’s success has been the play of point guard Julyan Stone and shooting guard Keith Langford, but another key player has been Russian guard Anton Kurbanov.</p>
<p>Kurbanov, 26, is in his fourth season with UNICS and is a key part of head coach Evgeny Murzin’s rotation. He is averaging 9.7 points, 5.3 rebounds, and 1.8 assists per game in EuroCup play this season, and he has stepped up his game in big moments.</p>
<p>In UNICS’ Round of 16 win over Cedevita Zagreb last month, Kurbanov scored a game-high 22 points on 8-of-10 shooting to help lead his team to victory. He followed that up with 18 points and 7 rebounds in a win over Crvena Zvezda Belgrade in the quarterfinals, and he was huge down the stretch in UNICS’ semifinal series against Khimki Moscow Region.</p>
<p>In Game 1 of that series, Kurbanov came off the bench to score 16 points on 6-of-9 shooting, including 3-of-5 from 3-point range, to lead UNICS to a 92-85 win. He then had 14 points and 9 rebounds in Game 2 as UNICS took a 2-0 lead in the series.</p>
<p>Kurbanov was born in Samarkand, Uzbekistan and played for Russia at both the junior and senior levels prior to joining UNICS. He is not afraid of taking big shots or making plays in crunch time, and he will be crucial for UNICS if they want to upset Real Madrid and win their first European title.</p>
<h1 id="What-will-blackjack-desk-UNICS-do-without-Nikita-Kurbanov"><a href="#What-will-blackjack-desk-UNICS-do-without-Nikita-Kurbanov" class="headerlink" title="What will blackjack desk UNICS do without Nikita Kurbanov?"></a>What will blackjack desk UNICS do without Nikita Kurbanov?</h1><p>This summer, the Khimki Moscow Region basketball club, also known as UNICS, lost one of its key players - Nikita Kurbanov. The 27-year-old Kurbanov is a three-time Russian champion and two-time Euroleague participant. UNICS’ General Manager Dmitry Shvidchenko has already started looking for a replacement but the decision won’t be easy.</p>
<p>Kurbanov was not just an excellent player but also a great leader on the court. His departure leaves a big hole in the team that will be difficult to fill. However, Shvidchenko remains hopeful and believes that his team can still achieve great results this season.</p>
<p>So far, there have been several offers from other clubs for Kurbanov but he has yet to decide where he will play next. In the meantime, UNICS is doing its best to prepare for the new season without him and is training hard in order to be ready for the start of the Russian League Championships in October.</p>
<h1 id="Could-Kurbanov’s-departure-lead-to-blackjack-desk-UNICS’-downfall"><a href="#Could-Kurbanov’s-departure-lead-to-blackjack-desk-UNICS’-downfall" class="headerlink" title="Could Kurbanov’s departure lead to blackjack desk UNICS’ downfall?"></a>Could Kurbanov’s departure lead to blackjack desk UNICS’ downfall?</h1><p>In early December, Russian center Dmitry Kurbanov left UNICS Kazan to join NBA’s Golden State Warriors on a three-year deal. The news hit the team hard and some fear that it could lead to their eventual downfall.</p>
<p>Kurbanov was an important player for the team, having averaged 14 points and 8 rebounds last season. His departure leaves a major hole in the team’s roster that coach Georgios Bartzokas will need to fill.</p>
<p>One possible solution is to move Pacho Simulation from power forward to center. This would allow Vladimir Ivlev to take over at power forward. However, this switch could lead to problems defensively.</p>
<p>Another option is to bring in another center, such as Romanian big man Catalin Burlacu. However, he is not likely to be an adequate replacement for Kurbanov.</p>
<p>Overall, it remains to be seen how Kurbanov’s departure will affect UNICS’ performance. If Bartzokas can find a way to fill the hole left by Kurbanov, they may still be able to compete for the title. However, if he cannot, they may struggle this season.</p>
