#  Counselor Can Help You Address Your Gambling Addiction

A gambling addiction can be a devastating problem, both for the individual and for their loved ones. Fortunately, help is available. Counseling can be an effective way to address a gambling addiction and to begin recovering from it.

Counseling can provide individuals with the support they need to understand their addiction and to change their behavior. The therapist will work with the person to develop a treatment plan that meets their specific needs. This may include therapy, education about gambling addiction, and strategies for relapse prevention.

Loved ones of people with gambling addictions can also benefit from counseling. They can learn how to best support their loved one as they work toward recovery, and they can receive support themselves in dealing with the impact of the addiction.

If you or someone you love is struggling with a gambling addiction, don’t hesitate to seek help. Counseling can make all the difference in overcoming this disorder and rebuilding your life.

#  Counselor Teaches How To Deal With Triggers For Gambling Addiction

Counselor Ronald Kronberg, LCPC, CADC, shares his wisdom on how to deal with gambling addiction triggers. Kronberg is the clinical director of The Meadows’ Gambling Treatment Program in Wickenburg, Arizona.

“First and foremost, it’s important to understand your personal triggers for gambling addiction. Once you know what these are, you can work on developing strategies to manage them. For example, if socializing with friends leads to online gambling, try avoiding situations where this is likely to happen. Or if watching sports results in placing bets, find another activity to fill that time slot. Bottom line: be proactive in managing your triggers.

In addition, practice healthy coping mechanisms when you experience stress or negative emotions. This may include exercise, journaling or talking with a friend or therapist. By doing so, you will increase your resilience and be less likely to turn to gambling as a coping strategy.

Finally, build a support network of people who can offer encouragement and accountability. These individuals can provide a sounding board when temptation strikes and help keep you on track in your recovery journey.”
