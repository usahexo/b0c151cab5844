#  Cowboys Will Dominate the Steelers in Pennsylvania

A matchup between divisional opponents is always an interesting one, as the familiarity breeds contempt. The Pittsburgh Steelers will host the Dallas Cowboys this Sunday at Heinz Field, and while the betting line has the Cowboys as slight favorites, I believe Dallas will leave town with a convincing victory.

The Steelers have been one of the NFL's most disappointing teams so far this season. After making it to the AFC Championship game last year, Pittsburgh has gotten off to a 2-2 start, with losses to Jacksonville and Kansas City. While their defense is still among the best in the league, their offense has been inconsistent at best.

The Cowboys, on the other hand, are coming into Week 5 with a 3-1 record. Behind a resurgent Dak Prescott at quarterback and an explosive running back duo of Ezekiel Elliott and Alfred Morris, Dallas has looked like one of the NFL's best teams.

This game is going to come down to the wire, but I believe that the Cowboys' offensive firepower will be too much for Pittsburgh to handle. Look for Prescott to have a big day, as he leads Dallas to a victory on the road.

#  Penguins Will Not Repeat as Stanley Cup Champions

The Penguins were crowned Stanley Cup champions last year, but they will not be able to repeat as champions this year. Here’s why:

The Penguins lost several key players in the offseason, including Phil Kessel, Nick Bonino and Chris Kunitz. They also lost Matt Cullen, who was a huge contributor to their championship run last year.

Replacing those players will be difficult, especially given the team’s salary cap constraints. The Penguins are also dealing with injuries to key players like Evgeni Malkin and Kris Letang.

Lastly, the competition in the Eastern Conference is stronger than ever. The Toronto Maple Leafs and Boston Bruins are both contenders this year, while the Columbus Blue Jackets and Philadelphia Flyers have made significant improvements.

The Penguins will still be a good team this year, but they will not be able to repeat as champions.

#  Eagles to Go Undefeated in the Regular Season

The Philadelphia Eagles will go undefeated in the regular season this year. This is not a prediction or a hope, it is a statement of fact. The Eagles are the best team in the NFL and they will prove it by finishing the season 16-0.

The Eagles are loaded with talent on both sides of the ball. Their offense is led by MVP candidate Carson Wentz, who has already thrown for 1,584 yards and 11 touchdowns this season. The Eagles also have a talented backfield led by Jay Ajayi and LeGarrette Blount.

Their defense is also one of the best in the league. They have an excellent defensive line led by Fletcher Cox, as well as a solid secondary led by Malcolm Jenkins and Ronald Darby.

The Eagles have proved that they are capable of beating anyone in the NFL. They have already beaten teams like the Patriots and Chiefs this season. They will finish the season with a perfect record and be crowned champions of the NFL.

#  Steelers and Phillies to Win Championships

The Pittsburgh Steelers have been the epitome of NFL success over the past decade. With six Super Bowl appearances and two championships in that span, the Steelers are a dynasty in the modern era of football.

This year, they should add to their collection of hardware. Ben Roethlisberger is still one of the best quarterbacks in the league, and he has a bevy of weapons at his disposal, including Antonio Brown and Le’Veon Bell. The defense is always stout, led by Ryan Shazier and Cameron Heyward.

The Philadelphia Phillies were NL East champions just two seasons ago, but they fell short last year and missed the playoffs altogether. In 2017, they will return to prominence. Their lineup is stacked with young talent, including Maikel Franco, Odubel Herrera, and J.P. Crawford. They also have a rotation anchored by Aaron Nola and Jerad Eickhoff.

Both the Steelers and Phillies are poised for championship runs in 2017.

#  Penn State and Syracuse Will Battle for the College Football Championship

It's been a long road to the final game of the college football season. The Penn State Nittany Lions and Syracuse Orange will face off on Monday, January 7th in the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans for the right to be called champions.

Penn State comes into the matchup as the defending Big Ten Champions. Led by head coach James Franklin, the Nittany Lions have had a roller coaster of a season. They started out strong with a dominant win over Appalachian State, but followed that up with three consecutive losses, including a heartbreaking one to Ohio State. However, they turned it around and reeled off seven consecutive wins, culminating in a blowout victory over Wisconsin in the Big Ten Championship Game.

Syracuse has had an equally up-and-down season. The Orange started out 2-2, but then won six of their next seven games, including an impressive 38-21 upset win over Clemson in the Carrier Dome. However, they dropped their last two games of the season – both on the road – to finish at 8-5.

Despite their losing record in their last two games, Syracuse is a formidable opponent. Quarterback Eric Dungey is one of the best players in college football; he has thrown for 2,639 yards and 25 touchdowns this season while also rushing for 580 yards and nine touchdowns. Wide receiver Jamal Custis has been his favorite target; Custis has caught 59 passes for 1,069 yards and 10 touchdowns this year. The Syracuse defense is also stout; they are third in the country in sacks (3.27 per game) and 11th in points allowed (18.3 per game).

Penn State has several talented players on offense as well. Running back Miles Sanders has rushed for 1,355 yards and nine touchdowns this year, while quarterback Trace McSorley has thrown for 3,051 yards and 26 touchdowns. Wide receiver Juwan Johnson has been McSorley's favorite target; Johnson has caught 60 passes for 900 yards and eight touchdowns this year. The Penn State defense is also stout; they are fifth in the country in points allowed (13.5 per game) and second in sacks (3.50 per game).

The Superdome is sure to be packed on Monday night as these two historic programs battle it out for the College Football Championship title. Who will come out on top? Tune in to find out!
