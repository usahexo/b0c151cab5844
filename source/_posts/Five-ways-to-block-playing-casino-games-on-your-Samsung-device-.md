#  How to stop Casino games from automatically loading on your Samsung device 

The Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9+ are great devices, but there’s one issue that people have been reporting with the two new devices – casino games automatically loading on the device. 
One thing that you may not know about your Samsung Galaxy device is that whenever you connect to the internet, whether it be through a Wi-Fi network or your mobile data, certain apps will automatically start up in the background. 
This is generally a good thing as it means that you don’t have to wait for an app to start up when you want to use it, but this can sometimes cause issues if an app starts up that you don’t want to use. 
For example, some people have reported that casino games have been automatically loading on their Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9+, even if they don’t want to play them. 
If this is happening to you, then don’t worry – we’re going to show you how to stop casino games from automatically loading on your Samsung device.

The first thing you need to do is open the Settings app on your Samsung Galaxy S9 or S9+. 
Once the Settings app has opened, scroll down and tap on “Applications”. 
From here, tap on “Background running services”. 
Scroll down until you see the “Casino Games” listing and tap on it. 
Now, toggle off the switch next to “Auto-launch Casino Games”. 
You should now be able to play casino games without them automatically loading on your Samsung device.

#  How do I prevent my Samsung device from opening casino websites? 

Casinos can be fun places to visit, but they are not always the best places for your wallet. If you have a Samsung device and want to keep yourself from accidentally visiting casino websites, there are a few things you can do. 

The first thing you can do is install a browser extension that will block casino websites. There are many different extensions available, so you should be able to find one that meets your needs. 

Another thing you can do is add casino websites to your "restricted sites" list. This will prevent your device from opening them automatically, and you will have to manually enter the address of the website each time you want to visit it. 

Finally, you can set up a parental control account and add casino websites to the restricted list. This will ensure that even if someone else is using your device, they will not be able to visit casino websites.

#  Why can't I play casino games on my Samsung phone or tablet? 

Samsung devices may be some of the most popular on the market, but they are not currently approved by major online casinos for real-money gameplay. This is likely due to security concerns, as Samsung devices have been known to be vulnerable to hacking.

This hasn't stopped some enterprising players from attempting to find ways around the restriction, but it's generally not advised. Casino games are designed to be fair and reliable, and circumventing their security measures could lead to disastrous results. 

If you're looking for a great casino gaming experience, it's best to stick to devices that are approved by the casinos themselves. This way, you can be sure that your gameplay will be safe and fair.
