#  Joel Coen's baccarat prohibition

In 1924, Joel Coen's great grand father, Samuel Coen, opened a baccarat prohibition in St. Louis. A speakeasy during the prohibition era, it was one of the only places in the city where one could play the game of baccarat.

Baccarat is a simple game that can be played with as few as two players and a deck of cards. The aim of the game is to draw cards with a value as close to nine as possible. The player with the highest total at the end of the hand wins.

Baccarat has always been popular among gamblers and its popularity increased during prohibition when Americans were looking for new ways to gamble legally.

Samuel Coen's speakeasy was a hit and soon became one of the most popular destinations in the city for baccarat players. It remained open throughout prohibition and continued to be popular after prohibition ended.

Today, Joel Coen's great grand father's speakeasy is still open for business and is now run by Joel's uncle, Neil Coen. Neil has been running the speakeasy since 1984 and has been passed down the secret recipe for Samuel Coen's famous baccarat prohibition punch.

#  Who is Joel Coen prohibited from baccarat?

Joel Coen, the writer, producer and director of films such as Fargo and The Big Lebowski is famously banned from playing baccarat in casinos. This is because he has a very successful track record at the game, and casinos don't like to lose money.

Coen started playing baccarat in casino in his early 20s, and quickly developed a reputation for being a very skilled player. He often walked away from the table with large profits, which angered the casino staff. In one instance, a casino security guard actually threatened Coen with violence if he didn't leave the casino immediately.

Given his history of winning at baccarat, it's no surprise that casinos have blacklisted Coen and refuse to let him play. This hasn't stopped him from trying though - he was once seen entering a casino in London disguised as an elderly woman!

#  Joel Coen's Baccarat restrictions

In January of 2017, Joel Coen, a baccarat enthusiast, was barred from two Las Vegas casinos because he was winning too much money. The casinos, MGM Grand and Venetian, cited their right to refuse service to any patron they saw fit.

Coen's winnings were modest by casino standards--$1,500 at MGM and $2,000 at Venetian. He insists that he didn't know the rules of the games he was playing and simply got lucky. But casino executives believe that he was using a technique called "back counting," which involves keeping track of the cards as they are played in order to gain an advantage over the house.

Whatever his methods, Coen's success infuriated casino executives who have been known to ban players for far less. In October of 2016, for example, four players were banned from Caesars Palace for allegedly marking cards.

Casino officials are quick to point out that they are not required to allow anyone into their establishments. "The resorts reserve the right to exclude or eject any person or group of people for any reason whatsoever," said MGM Grand spokesman Gordon Absher.

But while casinos may be within their rights to refuse service to anyone they choose, some experts believe that they may be shooting themselves in the foot by doing so.

"There is absolutely no question that casinos would be better off if they embraced and accommodated high-rolling baccarat players like Joel Coen," said gaming analyst Alan Feldman. "These are the guys who are willing to bet tens of thousands of dollars on a single hand."

Feldman went on to say that barring big spenders like Coen only serves to drive them underground where they can gamble elsewhere--possibly in black markets where casinos have no control over the games or the players.

#  What is Joel Coen prohibited from playing in baccarat?

Joel Coen is a movie director, producer, screenwriter, and editor. He is one half of the Coen brothers along with his brother Ethan. The two have collaborated on most of their films.

Out of all the games in a casino, baccarat is the one Joel Coen is prohibited from playing. It's not because he can't afford to lose - in fact, he's rumored to be quite a high roller. So what's the reason?

Apparently, Coen was caught counting cards at a baccarat table back in the early 1990s. Casinos don't take kindly to people who try to gain an edge over the house, so he was banned from playing the game.

Interestingly enough, this rule doesn't seem to apply to his brother Ethan. The two have co-directed several films together, and Ethan has even starred in some of them. But they've never worked on a project where they've both had a hand in directing and acting - presumably because that would require Joel to be able to play baccarat.

#  Joel Coen baccarat blacklist

The Coen brothers’ 1996 movie “The Cutter” is based on the true story of how Minnesota writer-director Joel Coen was blacklisted from playing baccarat in Vegas casinos after winning too much money.

Coen, then in his early 30s, had visited Las Vegas in 1989 with a friend and started playing baccarat at the Mirage, eventually building up a $5,000 stake. He took this winnings to the Golden Nugget, where he increased it to $20,000. The Nugget’s casino manager recognized Coen and warned him that if he didn’t leave soon, he would be banned from all Nevada casinos.

Coen left Nevada but continued to play baccarat in offshore casinos. In 1992, he returned to Vegas with $1 million in winnings and promptly lost it all at the Bellagio.
