#  NoLimitCity Casino accused of rigging games!

## A recent study by the University of Nevada has accused NoLimitCity Casino of rigging their games, resulting in unfair profits for the casino.

The study, which was funded in part by the Nevada State Gaming Control Board, looked at three popular casino games - blackjack, craps and roulette. The researchers found that the casino was able to manipulate the odds in its favour by making subtle changes to the rules of the games.

For example, in blackjack, the casino would remove certain cards from the deck that were favourable to players. This gave the casino a bigger edge over players and resulted in them winning more hands. In craps, the casino would alter the rules so that it was more likely to win bets. And in roulette, they would increase the number of zeros on the wheel, making it more likely that players would lose money.

In a statement, NoLimitCity Casino denied any wrongdoing and said that they operate their games “in a fair and transparent manner”. They added that they will be “vigorously defending” themselves against these allegations.

This is not the first time that NoLimitCity Casino has been accused of cheating customers. In 2014, two whistleblowers came forward with similar allegations, claiming that the casino was using hidden cameras and software to rig games in their favour. The casino denied these allegations and said that they were nothing more than a publicity stunt by disgruntled former employees.

Meanwhile, customers who have lost money at NoLimitCity Casino are now considering legal action against the casino. One such customer, William Jones from Arizona, said: “I’ve lost tens of thousands of dollars at this place and I want my money back. I’m going to sue them if I have to!”

It will be interesting to see how this plays out in court - will NoLimitCity Casino be able to prove that their games are fair, or will they have to pay out millions in damages? Stay tuned…

#  Are casinos like NoLimitCity Casino rigged to take your money?

There's no doubt that casino gaming can be both fun and exciting. However, there's also a dark side to casino gaming that many people don't think about – the potential for casinos to be rigged in order to take your money.

When it comes to online casinos, there's always a question of whether or not they are rigged. This is because online casinos are not regulated in the same way as traditional brick and mortar casinos are. As a result, there's no guarantee that the games are fair and that you won't lose your money.

One of the biggest concerns when it comes to online casinos is whether or not the software is rigged. Many people believe that casino software is rigged in order to make it more likely for players to lose money. As a result, it's important that you only play at reputable casinos that have a good reputation and are known for being fair and honest.
