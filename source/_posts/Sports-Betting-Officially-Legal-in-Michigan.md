#  Sports Betting Officially Legal in Michigan

Michigan residents can now legally bet on sports after the state’s gaming commission approved several sports betting operators this week.

The state’s four licensed casino operators – MGM, Penn National Gaming, Greektown, and MotorCity – will offer sports betting at their properties. The Detroit Lions and the Detroit Tigers are among the professional teams whose games will be available for legal betting.

Betting on college sports is also allowed, including Michigan’s big three schools – the University of Michigan Wolverines, Michigan State Spartans, and Eastern Michigan Eagles.

Michigan is the 10th state to allow some form of legal sports betting, following New Jersey, Delaware, Mississippi, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, New Mexico, Iowa, and Indiana.

Charles Zieber of Lansing was among the first in line to place a bet at MGM Grand Casino in Detroit. He wagered $10 on the Detroit Lions beating the Arizona Cardinals this weekend.

“I think it’s great. I can finally do some legal betting on my home team games now that it’s legal here in Michigan. I might even make a trip down to Detroit to place some bets at one of the MGM properties there,” said Zieber.

While sports betting will generate revenue for the state's casinos and its horse racing industry, it is not expected to be a major windfall. The state's gambling regulators project that sports betting will bring in an additional $8 million annually to state coffers.

#  First Sports Betting Operation Opens in Michigan

Michigan is the latest state to legalize sports betting operations within its borders. The first sports betting parlor opened for business on Tuesday in downtown Detroit.

The new facility offers a variety of wagering options on professional and collegiate sporting events. Customers can place bets at traditional betting windows or through a mobile app.

The legalization of sports betting in Michigan follows a Supreme Court decision last year that overturned a federal ban on the practice. Since then, several states have moved to legalize sports betting, including neighboring Ohio and Indiana.

Michigan had initially been resistant to legalizing sports betting, but officials eventually conceded that the practice could generate significant revenue for the state. The Michigan Lottery Commission has projected that sports betting could bring in as much as $aspiring to be the next Las Vegas by bringing in as much as $25 million in annual revenue.

Sports betting is already a major industry in the United States, with over $150 billion wagered annually. The new facility in Detroit represents the first step in tapping into this market for Michigan businesses and generating new revenue for the state.

#  Michigan Senate OKs Bill Allowing Sports Wagering

Michigan's Republican-led state Senate approved legislation on Wednesday that would allow sports betting in the state,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) sending the bill to the House of Representatives.

The proposed law would let Michigan residents place bets on professional and amateur sports, beginning as soon as next year. The state would regulate and tax sports betting, with a portion of the proceeds going to schools, community colleges and universities.

"Sports betting is happening anyway," said Republican state Senator Mike Kowall, the bill's sponsor. "We might as well legalize it, tax it and use the money for good purposes."

Similar bills have been introduced in a number of other states in recent months as the U.S. Supreme Court prepares to rule on a case that could overturn a federal ban on most sports betting outside of Nevada.

In 2011, New Jersey unsuccessfully challenged the federal ban in court. The state is now asking the high court to overturn a lower court ruling that sided with leagues including the National Football League, Major League Baseball and National Basketball Association, which argue that gambling could threaten the integrity of their games.

Michigan is one of several states where lawmakers are racing to pass legislation before any decision from the Supreme Court. Bills have been introduced in Iowa, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts and West Virginia.

#  Proposal to Legalize Sports Betting in Michigan Sent to Governor

On October 26, 2018, a proposal was sent to Michigan Governor Rick Snyder to legalize sports betting in the state. The proposal was written by State Senator Curtis Hertel Jr. and co-sponsored by Representatives Lisa Lyons and Brandt Iden.

"The proposal would allow casinos, racetracks and other authorized gambling facilities in Michigan to offer betting on professional and collegiate sporting events," writes Bridge Magazine reporter Riley Beggin. "It would also allow bets to be placed online or through mobile devices."

According to the proposal, 10% of the total amount wagered would go towards funding Michigan's public schools.

Hertel told Bridge Magazine, "This is a common sense solution that will create jobs, fund our schools and protect Michigan consumers."

Michigan is one of six states that do not currently have any form of legalized sports betting.

#  Michigan Becomes Latest State to Legalize Sports Betting

Michigan has become the latest state to legalize sports betting, following the repeal of the state’s ban on the activity.

House Bill 4926 was passed by the Michigan state legislature in October and signed into law by Governor Gretchen Whitmer in November. The new law allows licensed casinos and horse racing tracks in the state to offer sports betting, with online and mobile wagering also permitted.

Michigan is now one of 10 states that have legalized sports betting since the Supreme Court overturned the federal ban on the activity in May 2018. Other states that have legalized sports betting include New Jersey, Delaware, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Mississippi, Arkansas, Tennessee, Indiana and Iowa.

State officials expect that Michigan’s legalization of sports betting will generate around $100 million in annual revenue. This will be used to support education and infrastructure projects in the state.
