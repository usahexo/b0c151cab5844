#  The Particular Sunday Read: The History of Poker and What Lies Ahead

Sunday is typically considered a day for rest and relaxation, but for some, it’s a day to indulge in a favorite pastime. Poker has been around for centuries and its popularity continues to grow. Whether you’re a beginner or experienced player, there’s always something new to learn about this intriguing game.

Poker is believed to originate from an ancient Persian game known as “As Nas”. This five-card game was played with a deck of 20 cards and was very similar to modern poker. In the early 1800s, poker began to gain in popularity in the United States. The first Poker Tournament was held in New Orleans in 1829 and was won by a man named Jonathan H. Green.

Green is credited with developing many of the rules that are still used today, such as the ranking of hands. He is also believed to be the first person to use the term “poker”. In 1834, he published a book entitled “An Exposure of the Arts and Miseries of Gambling” which detailed how to play poker and revealed some of the strategies used by professional players.

The game continued to grow in popularity and in 1845, The New York Herald ran an article entitled “Poker – A National Game”. This article highlighted the fact that poker was being played by people from all walks of life, including presidents and celebrities.

In 1864, The Atlantic Monthly published an article called “The Science of Poker” which discussed the mathematical aspects of the game. This marked the beginning of poker being recognized as a legitimate sport. In 1970, Bobby Baldwin became the first professional poker player to win $1 million in tournament earnings.

Since then, the popularity of poker has continued to grow and there are now numerous tournaments with large prize pools. In 2011, Phil Ivey became the first player to win over $20 million in tournament earnings. The future looks bright for poker and it shows no signs of losing its appeal anytime soon. Whether you’re playing for fun or money, there’s always something new to learn about this fascinating game
