#  What is the Oriental Game at the Bons vegas x casino?

The oriental game at the Bons Vegas x casino is a game of chance that is played with cards. The object of the game is to accumulate points by taking as many tricks as possible. The player who takes the most number of tricks wins the game.

The game begins by dealing six cards to each player, face down. The remainder of the deck is placed in the middle of the players, face down. The player to the left of the dealer starts the game and play passes clockwise. On a player’s turn, they draw one card from either the deck or from another player’s hand. They must then play one card, which can either be placed face up on the table or kept hidden in their hand. The Ace is high and the Two is low. When both players have played all their cards, the player with the highest card in their hand wins the trick and accumulates points equivalent to that card value. If there is a tie, neither player accumulates any points for that trick. The first player to accumulate ten points wins the game.

There are a few things to keep in mind when playing this game:

-You cannot lead with a two or an ace; these are called “point cards” and must be played last
-A Jack (J) beats any other card except an Ace (A) or another Jack (J)
