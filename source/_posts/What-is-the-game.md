#  What is the game?

The game is a digital collectible card game set in a sci-fi world.

Players battle against each other with decks of cards, featuring characters and creatures from the game's lore.

Victory goes to the player who can reduce their opponent's health to zero first.

# The Cards

Each card has a certain amount of power, which is used to attack enemies or cast spells.

There are three different colors of magic - blue, green and red - and each color has its own unique properties.

Some cards also have special abilities that can be activated during battle.

# The Lore

The game takes place in a future world that has been torn apart by war. The remaining few humans must fight for survival against the machines that now rule the planet.


The story unfolds through the cards themselves, which tell the tales of famous heroes and villains from the world of Etheria.

#  What is the variance?

The variance is a measure of the spread of a data set. It is calculated by taking the differences between each data point and the mean, squaring them, and then dividing by the number of data points minus one. This gives us a unit-free measure of how spread out our data is.

# Computing the variance

The variance can be computed easily in Python using the numpy library:

import numpy as np


x = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
y = np.array([6, 7, 8, 9, 10])


print("The variance is {}".format(np.var(x))) # prints "The variance is 5"

#  What are the settings?

In Photoshop, the Preferences dialog box is where you set all of the program’s options. You can access it by going to Edit > Preferences (Windows) or Photoshop > Preferences (Mac). There are a wealth of settings to choose from, so let’s take a look at some of the most important ones.

# Interface

The Interface section contains settings that control how Photoshop looks and behaves.

# Workspace

The Workspace option lets you choose between different window layouts. The Standard layout is the default, and it has three panels – Layers, Channels, and Paths – open on the right-hand side of the screen. The Essentials layout has just two panels – Layers and Channels – open on the right-hand side of the screen. And finally, the Custom layout lets you choose which panels are open and in what order.

# Arrange Documents

This setting controls how new documents are opened. By default, Photoshop opens all documents in one large window, but you can change it so that each document opens in its own window by selecting “Window” from the drop-down menu. You can also choose whether to have documents overlap (the default setting) or not overlap. Overlapping windows can be useful when you want to see two or more documents at the same time, but they can also be confusing because they can obscure part of each document.

# Display Performance

This setting determines how quickly Photoshop updates the display when you make changes to an image. By default, it’s set to High Quality so that you get a good quality display, but this can slow down Photoshop’s performance. If you want to speed up Photoshop’s performance, set this option to Low Quality.

#  What are the rules?

There are no hard and fast rules when it comes to creating a style guide, but there are a few basics that should be considered.

1. Establish a style standard

Every company has their own style that they want their employees to adhere to. This could be anything from how to format email addresses to how to write dates. The key is to have one standard and make sure everyone is aware of it.

2. stick to the standard

Once the standard is set, it's important to stick to it. This can be difficult when different team members may have their own preferences or ideas on how things should be done, but by maintaining consistency, you'll create a more professional image for your brand.

3. Be specific where needed

While it's important to maintain a general style throughout your documents, there will inevitably be occasions when you need to be more specific. For example, if you're writing about a product that has multiple color options, you'll need to specify which colors you're referring to. Or, if you're formatting an address, you'll need to decide whether or not to include the country code. By being specific where needed, you'll avoid any confusion or inconsistency.

4. Use templates whenever possible

Templates can be a great way of ensuring consistent formatting across your documents. If everyone is using the same templates, then there's less chance for variation in style. Plus, templates can help speed up the drafting process, which is always a bonus!

#  What are the payouts?

The average block reward is 12.5 bitcoins, but varies because the

bitcoin system is designed to produce a total of 21 million bitcoins. 

The block reward halves every 210,000 blocks, or about 4 years. So, the latest payout would be 6.25 bitcoins. 

# What else affects bitcoin payout?

The Bitcoin protocol rewards miners for verifying and committing transactions to the blockchain. Miners also earn fees from users sending transactions. The combination of these two factors results in varying payouts for miners. In periods of high transaction volume, miner payouts can be greater than when there are fewer transactions taking place.
